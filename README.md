# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor (sjb-PWA-Text-Editor)

## Description

This single-page application is a text editor that runs in the browser and meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline and has been deployed to Heroku.
